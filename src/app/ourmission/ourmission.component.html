        <h1>Welcome to an Award Winning <strong>Recruitment</strong> Agency</h1>
        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>It is a long established 
            fact that a reader will be 
            distracted by the readable 
            content of a page when looking 
            at its layout. The point of using 
            Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
            normal distribution of letters, as opposed 
            to using 'Content here, content here', making
             it look like readable English.</p>
        <h2>Our vision</h2>
        <p>Many desktop publishing packages and 
            web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
            as their default model text, and a search
             for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
              still in their infancy. Various versions have 
              evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
              sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
